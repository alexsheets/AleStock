AleStock is a portfolio project I am currently working on to combine skills of web development and ML programming to pursue an interest in stocks.

Current Buildout:

--> Users can supply their own SimFin API key and other relevant information to retain full financials of any stock


--> Reports are stored in database after being requested once in order for quicker retrieval/less network requests

--> Database linked to free database service Supabase. Project full setup of Supabase connection in an ASP.NET project which proved difficult to find online.

--> Simfin API written in Python and fully tested. Deployed using PythonNET which can run Python code within .NET projects

--> Chat built using C# SignalR package
