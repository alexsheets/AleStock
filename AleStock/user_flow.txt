Current User Flow for AleStock:
---------------------------
--> Login
----> Register (if need be)
---------------------------
--> Continue to a home screen?
--> Can access the 'chat' functionality immediately after signing up
--> Currently sends user to FinanceAnalyzation.cshtml which allows the user to submit their parameters
(ticker, quarter, year)
----> IF USER HAS NO SIMFIN KEY LOGGED IN DATABASE: send to Stock/SupplyKey.cshtml
----> ONCE THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED, back to FinanceAnalyzation.cshtml
--> Upon submission of SubmitStockChoices along with user who has associated SimFin key, send to view SpecificFinancials.cshtml
--------------------------
--> Allow user to click a button from SpecificFinancials.cshtml which performs an AI analysis
and returns them to AIFinanceSummarization.cshtml
----> IF USER HAS NO OPENAI KEY LOGGED IN DATABASE: send to AI/SupplyKey.cshtml
----> ONCE THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED, back to FinanceAnalyzation.cshtml 
(parameters saved in httpcontext so no need to resubmit as long as these specific financials have been scraped and added to DB)



IDEAS:
--> move api key submission entirely to front of flow
--> work on frontend in general
